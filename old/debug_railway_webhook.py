    print("\n1. 🔗 BROKEN WEBHOOK:")
    print("   - GitHub not sending notifications to Railway")
    print("   - Railway webhook URL invalid/corrupted")

    print("\n2. 🌿 BRANCH FILTERING:")
    print("   - Railway ignoring commits from certain branches")
    print("   - Or only listening to specific commit messages")

    print("\n3. 🚫 COMMIT FILTERING:")
    print("   - Railway filtering out 'empty' commits")
    print("   - Or commits with certain keywords")

    print("\n" + "="*50)

    print("⚡ QUICK TEST:")

    print("\n1. Make real code change:")
